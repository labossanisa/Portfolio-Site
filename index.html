  <p title="Biography"> I am the middle child of two sisters and one brother.I currently attend Langston Hughes and am a rising junior.My birthday is Decemeber 23rd and I am a Capricorn. I was born between Sagittarus and a Capricorn so some I am a mixture of both. In my independent time, I tend to paint on anything I can get my hands on.I'm an expert in experiencing new things to learn more about myself.I'm also a indecisive and introverted person so I do everything to try an open myself up and make better decisions that'll absolutely better me in my later life. I love to learn, mostly about history and everything that brought us, as in the people, to this future day. Im obsessed with creativity and suceeding.</p>
